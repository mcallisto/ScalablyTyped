    * When searching for code, you can get text match metadata for the file **content** and file **path** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#text-match-metadata).

    * **Note:** You must [authenticate](https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication) to search for code across all public repositories.
    *
    * **Considerations for code search**
    *
    * Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:
    *
    * *   Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch.
    * *   Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.
    * *   You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for [`language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code) is not valid, while [`amazing language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code) is.

    * Here, we're searching for the keyword `addClass` within a file's contents. We're making sure that we're only looking in files where the language is JavaScript. And we're scoping the search to the `repo:jquery/jquery` repository.
