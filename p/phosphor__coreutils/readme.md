## Comments

These comments are from the typescript definitions and might be useful:
```
/**
 * A type alias for a JSON primitive.
 */
/**
 * An object which stores MIME data for general application use.
 *
 * #### Notes
 * This class does not attempt to enforce "correctness" of MIME types
 * and their associated data. Since this class is designed to transfer
 * arbitrary data and objects within the same application, it assumes
 * that the user provides correct and accurate data.
 */
/**
 * A class which wraps a promise into a delegate object.
 *
 * #### Notes
 * This class is useful when the logic to resolve or reject a promise
 * cannot be defined at the point where the promise is created.
 */
/**
 * The namespace for random number related functionality.
 */
/**
 * A runtime object which captures compile-time type information.
 *
 * #### Notes
 * A token captures the compile-time type of an interface or class in
 * an object which can be used at runtime in a type-safe fashion.
 */
/**
 * The namespace for UUID related functionality.
 */
