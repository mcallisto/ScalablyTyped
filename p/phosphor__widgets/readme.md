## Comments

These comments are from the typescript definitions and might be useful:
```
/**
 * A sizer object for use with the box engine layout functions.
 *
 * #### Notes
 * A box sizer holds the geometry information for an object along an
 * arbitrary layout orientation.
 *
 * For best performance, this class should be treated as a raw data
 * struct. It should not typically be subclassed.
