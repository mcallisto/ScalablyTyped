```
/**
 * The names of the supported HTML5 DOM element attributes.
 *
 * This list is not all-encompassing, rather it attempts to define the
 * attribute names which are relevant for use in a virtual DOM context.
 * If a standardized or widely supported name is missing, please open
 * an issue to have it added.
 *
 * The attribute names were collected from the following sources:
 *   - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes
 *   - https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/index.html#attributes-1
 *   - https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#attributes-3
