ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES: This type of handshake represents a request to enable all features in an organization. It is always sent from the master account to only invited member accounts. Created accounts do not receive this because those accounts were created by the organization's master account and approval is inferred.    APPROVE_ALL_FEATURES: This type of handshake is sent from the Organizations service when all member accounts have approved the ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES invitation. It is sent only to the master account and signals the master that it can finalize the process to enable all features.

DECLINED: This handshake is no longer active because it was declined by the recipient account.    EXPIRED: This handshake is no longer active because the originator did not receive a response of any kind from the recipient before the expiration time (15 days).
