/**
 * Returns a boolean. Will be `true` if the code is running on a CI server,
 * otherwise `false`.
 *
 * Some CI servers not listed here might still trigger the `ci.isCI`
 * boolean to be set to `true` if they use certain vendor neutral environment
 * variables. In those cases `ci.name` will be `null` and no vendor specific
 * boolean will be set to `true`.
